# ray_tracing

This is a Rust implementation of Peter Shirley's series of [ray tracing books.](https://raytracing.github.io/) 
It's not entirely a na√Øve implementation of the original C++, instead often choosing a more idiomatic style. 
Cliff Biffle's [Rust implementation](https://github.com/cbiffle/rtiow-rust/) has been very useful as inspiration and 
to compare/debug my implementation.
